the Forum, to the Temple of Jupiter, where the general and his army
paid their vows to the gods, under whose auspices the victory had
been won.

18. calumnia paucorum: as though a few unprincipled men
were accustomed to block action by the Senate until they had re-
ceived bribes for changing their opinion. In this case, however,
the obstructionists were Pompey’s friends. 19. Q. Pompeius
Rufus afterward became governor of Africa (ac. 61). Nothing
more is known of him. 20. Q. Metellus Celer interests us as
being the friend to whom Cicero gave the proconsulship of his prov-
ince, Gallia citerior, in ac. 62. 22. indicavisset: indirect dis- ο
course for the direct indicaverit, as quoting the words of the decree.

Pago 22. 1. praemium: estimate the value of the reward in
our own currency ; see sestertius and sestertium in Vocab. 2. εδει-
tertia centum: the distributive -rather than the ordinal — is the
rule with sestertium. 4. gladlfitbriae tamfflae: any number of

city, and contained many fine residences belonging to the wealthy and
noble. Hence it needed an especially strong garrison both night and day.
Cicero’s house, as well as Catiline's, was on this hill. In the time of the

effect is called anaphora. 3. munitissimus habendi senatus locus:
