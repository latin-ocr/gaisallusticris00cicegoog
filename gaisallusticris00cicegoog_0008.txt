iv PREFACE.

’ Every available German, English, and American com·

mentary on Sallust has been consulted in the preparation ·

os the notes.

A collection of the epigrams of Sallust has been included
in this edition, in the hope that at least some os them may
be memorized, — a practice of our fathers, which may be
revived to great advantage in our day.

The editdr is indebted to Dr. Henry P. Warren for many
useful suggestions; and to the class of 1900 of the Albany
Academy, but more particularly to Mr. Edgar H. Goold‚
for valuable assistance in preparing the Index.
