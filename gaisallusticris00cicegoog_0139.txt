Pago 46. Outline os Oate’s speech. — We ought to be discussing,
not what punishment is due to the conspiratorS, but what would 116

My warnings have always gone unheeded in the past. But this
time it is a question, not 01 11101316, 11111 01 1116 31111 death. Mercy to
such scoundrels would only bring ruin down upon all loyal citizens.

If Caesar is afraid that violence will be used to release these men at
Rome, why 11066 116 advocate sending them 10 municipalities whose
1361111166 101 securing prisoners are not as good as 01116 ? But if he
only does not 1631 1116111, 111611 111616 16 311 1116 111016 reason 101 116 10 116

and trusting to the immortal gods to save you as 01 0111 110111 danger!

Think 01 Torquatus sentencing his own son to death 101 disobedi-

I would willingly allow you to 163111 3 1666011 from experience. But
the danger is imminent. We must act—if at all—at once.

Therefore, in view 01 1116 evidence, and 01 1116 prisoners‘ own con·
