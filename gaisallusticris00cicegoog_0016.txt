x INTRODUCTION.

Sallust's last work was a history in five books, Histoi-ide
rum Libri Quinque, embracing the important period between
Sulla's death, 13.c. 78, and Cicero's praetorship, Rc. 67. Of
this, unfortunately, we cannot judge‚ as only four speeches
and two letters remain.

SALLUST As A HISTORIAN.

The early Roman historians were mere annalists. The
best of them, writing in Greek, simply recorded events in
their order, without giving their causes or resultS. Cato
the Censor, B.0. 184, was the first annalist to write in Latin,
but he possessed no literary style, nor did any of the histo-
rians who closely followed him. More than'a century later,
Cicero declared that Sisenna (Sallust's immediate prede-
cessor) easily excelled all the Roman historians before his

 

time; but he, significantly added that even Sisenna's history -

was to a certain extent puerile.

It was precisely at this period, when cultured Romans
were displaying undisguised contempt ‚for the efforts of
their countrymen to write history, that Sallust's ambition

was aroused. He proposed to do for Roman history what ’

Thucydides had done for the Greek, — viz. to treat the sub-
ject philosophically, and¹ at the same time to maintain a
high standard of literary style. For this he was unusually
well qualified. In the first place, he was no mere student,
but a practical man of affairs, who had gained wide experi-
ence in Roman politics, and had been intimately associated
with many of the ablest men of his time. This gave him
'a breadth of view and a grasp of the true significance of
events, such as we look for in vain even in so versatile a
man as Cicero.

Again, Sallust was unusually painstaking in his search
after the truth. For example, before writing the Bellum
