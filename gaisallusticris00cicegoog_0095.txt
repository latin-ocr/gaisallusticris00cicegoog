ing. 4. seque, etc. : ⁴ they maintained both themselves and their
government.' 6. vindicatum est ina ‘ punishment was in-

⁷. tardius: ‘ too tardily ’ ; modifies excesserant. Sallust gives an
account of the punishment of A. Manlius Torquatus for this offence3
see 48, 23-27. Another instance is found in the Second Samnite
War, ss). 327-304‚ when Q. Fabius Maximus, in the absence of the
commander-in-chief, Papirius, engaged in battle with the enemy in
direct violation of orders, and won a great victory. Papirius immedi-
ately sentenced him to be executed. Fortunately for Fabius, he was
rescued by the army and taken to Rome, where Papirius at last, with
great reluctance, yielded to the entreaties of the Senate and spared
his life. But such Roman severity was not lacking even at the time
of Catiline's conspiracy; for Sallust states (30, 22-23) that when
Fulvius, the son of a senator, was captured while on his way to J'oin
Catiline’s forces, his own father ordered him to be put to death.

9. 10οό cedere: a military expression, ‘ to give way.' bene·
ficiis: referring probably to Rome’s liberal policy with her allies‚
which was to allow them an independent government, provided they
furnished regular contingents for the army. 11. Ignoscere quam
persequI: if both these verbs governed the accusative, we should
expect acceptam iniiiriam.

nations, and all seas and lands were open to them, then leisure
and wealth proved their ruin. Love of money destroyed their
honesty and fidelity, and made them proud and ornei, irreligious
and venal. Love of power made them false and deceitful. At first
these evils grew slowly; but soon they swept like a plague over the
state, until its rule became unendurable.

12. With ubi, notice the usual perfect indicative in several clauses
to denote single occurrences, followed by an imperfect, patebant, of a
continued state. 13. reges: like Pyrrhus, king of EpiruS, Antio-
chus the Great of Asia, Philip V. and Perseus of Macedonia, all of
