76 NOTES. [Paos 12

Pago 12. 1. ops· suan ‘his own resource& 4. quibus,
etc. ε ‘ whose necessities were most urgent, and who (therefore) were
utterly reckless.‘ 5. senatorii ordinis: all Romans who held
curule magistracies, or even the quaestorship‚ thereby became sena-
tors. Theoretically, this gave every citizen an opportunity of securing
the much coveted honor of a seat in the Senate; but practically it was
limited to the favored feW. For the Senate controlled the electione to
such an extent as to almost invariably insure the choice of its own
candidate 3 and these candidates were naturally from the senatorial
families. Hence, notwithstanding a republican form of government,
there arose in Rome the powerful senatorial order, forming a proud
and exclusive nobility. In dress the senators were distinguished by
the broad purple stripe— latus οῑᾶυιιε- on their tunics‚ and, if they -
had held a curule magistracy, by the purple shoe — malleus.

5. P. (Cornelius) Lentulus Sura had been consul in 71, but in
the next year had been expelled from the Senate on account of his
profligacy. By his election to the praetorship for 63, he regained his
place in the Senate. P. Autronius (Paetus): a schoolmate os
Cicer0, and quaestor in the same year with him. 6. 1.. Cassius
Longinus was praetor in 66, and was one of Cicero's competitors for
the consulship of 63. 0. Cethegus had already distinguished him-
self in the war with Sertorius by his reckless attempt to assassinate
Q. Metellus Pius. P. et Ser. Sullae: Sullae is plural, because it
belongs to both fflblius and Servius (as though we should say, Henry
and John Browns). These were sons of Servius Sulla, the brother of
the dictator. ’7. 1.. Vargunteius: nothing is known of him except
that he had been tried for bribery.

8. ex equestri ordine: in early Roman times, when it was ac·
counted a privilege to be a cavalryman, none but those whose property
amounted to 4ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ sesterces (817,000) or more could serve in the
cavalry. Later, when the Romans had no cavalry of their own, levy-
ing it all from their allies‚ the term equites was still applied to non-
patricians whose property was rated in the census as worth at least
400‚000 sesterces. These men often succeeded in amassing immense
fortunes in business or by speculation. But they had little political
influence until C. Gracchus, in no. 123, carried a measure providing
that the indiciis should be selected from the equites instead of the
nobiles. This at once arrayed them as a class against the senatorial
party3 and from this time forth, as a moneyed aristocracy, they pos-
sessed considerable power ln Roman politice, forming a middle class
