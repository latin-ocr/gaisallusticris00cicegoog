first Latia Redder.

Including Principles of Syntax and Exercises sor Translation. By
JARED W. SCUDDER, Latin Master in the Albany Academy.16mo,

eloth, 300 pages. Price, 90 cents.

Ὶ-ΙΕ first distinctive feature of this book is that the special
grammatica] points to be learned in each lesson are illus·
trated, not in disconnected sentenceS, but in a continuous Latin
story. This plan has the advantage of acting as a powerful in·
centive to work, and of emphasizing the fact that grammar is
merely the means to the enjoyment of literature.
The second feature is that the exercises for translating English
into Latin are based on the text immediately preceding them.
Other points of special importance are: the passages to be
translated at sight, included in every lesson after the nineteenth3
the questions for the pupil, which enable him to ascertain whether
he has thorougbly mastered his lesson; the incorporation of all
the necessary phciples of English Grammar in the body of the
book ; the questions in Latin referring to the text.

Gradatim.

An Easy Latin Translation Book for Beginners. By H. R. HEATLEY
and H. N. chnou. Revised by J. W. Scunnnn, Latin Master in
the Albany Academy. 16mo, eloth, 228 pages. Price, 50 cents.

RADATIM offers an excellent selection of easy reading-
matter which will serve to arouse and stimulate the interest
of the pupil in his early study of Latin. It may be used either
for lessons to be regularly prepared by classes just beginning the
subject, or for sight-reading by more advanced students. The
special excellence of Gradatim lies in the intrinsic interest of the
stories. In this respect it is equalled by no similar book that
has been ever issued.

Twenty-five pages of Latin stories, which illustrate the use of
the Accusative with the Infinitive, the Subjunctive of Indirect
Qestion, and the Ablative Absolute, have been added to the
original work. Tffis is the only edition of the book in which
these three subjects are especially treated.
