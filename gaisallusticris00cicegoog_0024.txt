There were rumors next day that violence would be
employed in freeing the five prisoners. On December 5th‚
therefore, Cicero assembled the Senate in the Temple of
Concord to decide what should be done in the case. At
first the sentiment seemed to be in favor 01 putting them
to death immediately, on the ground that they were dan-
gerous traitors to the state. Caesar, however, when his turn
came to speak, boldly declared that it was unconstitutional
to inflict capital punishment on Roman citizens without
allowing them to appeal to the people; he therefore favored
1116 imprisonment 101 the conspirators. His speech pro-
duced a strong impression on the Senate. When it became
evident that Caesar's motion might prevail, Cicero deliv-
ered his Fourth oration, in which he claimed that as proven
traitors the prisoners could'no longer be called Roman citi-
zens, and hence did not come under the provision 01 the
law. He therefore urged that they be immediately sen-
tenced to death. This oration partially turned the tide;
but it was left for Cato, in a most powerful and eloquent
speech, to finally persuade the Senate that the death penalty
was demanded by the danger 01 the im pending crisis. The
execution 01 the prisoners took place immediately, and ,
proved a death-blow to the conspiracy in the city.

For several weeks afterward, Catiline marched hither and
thither ⁴in the Apennines, seeking to avoid the armies sent
against him. At last, in January, Β.0. 62, finding his retreat
cut off in every direction, he met the legions 01 Antonius in
battle near Pistoria. He and his followers fought desper-
ately against an overwhelmingly superior 10166, but were
finally defeated and slain to a man.
