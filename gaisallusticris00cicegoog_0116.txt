Anxiety tn Rome ,· scene in the Senate when Catiline attempts to reply
ιο G'icero’s oration aqainst him. Section 31.

9 31. 9. ex: ‘asten’ diuturna quies: fifteen years had
elapsed since the last civil struggle had been fought in the streets

of Rome between the consuls, Lepidus and Catulus (3.0. 78).
10. omnls: why lony i? 14. quibus, etc.: ‘to whom, by reason

of the vastness of the empire, the sear of war had come, as some-

thing unusual.’ 19. eadem, etc. ε ‘ persisted in the same plans.’
20. Plautia: see· Vocab. interrogatus erat: see note¹ to 12,

273 the trial never took place. Catiline, however, with an air of
injured innocence, offered to put himself under the surveillance of any
responsible citizen. He even had the audacity to beg Cicero to watch
him, -at his home,— a dangerous task, which the consul promptly
declined. 21. 1.. Paulo: see Vocab.

Pago 23. 3. orationem: the first oration against Catiline‚ No-
vember 8, 63 nc. 4. quam postea scriptam edidit: Cicero pub-
lished this, as well as the rest of his consular speeches, in n.c. 60.
Hence it was unnecessary for Sallust to reproduce it here. 7. te-
mere: not from timeo. . 8. οἱ familia, etc.: i.e. his family con-
nections and his public career were such as to warrant the hope that
he would receive every state honor. 9. ne existumarent, etc. ε
‘ (he begged them) not to imagine that he, a patrician, who had con-
ferred many favors — on his own part and through his ancestors—
upon the-Roman people, wanted to ruin the state, when M. TulliuS, an

immigrant citizen of the city of Rome, was for saving it.'

i.e..the senators. bra voltusque: ‘ the expression on the faces ’3 what

‘⁴' rhetoricamgure is given here ‘2 B. 374, 43 A.3851; H. 751, 3, N.; G. 698.

we‘. in aedem Iovis Statoris: a temple vowed by Romulus to Jupiter,
for παρίης] the flight of the Romans in their battle with the Sabines.
7. ad patres conscriptos: the origin of this expression is still uncer-
tain. Some would interpose et, believing that patres was the title of the
patrician members oi the Senate during the monarchy, and that some
time after the establishment of the Republic a number of plebeians were
enrolled, and hence‘addressed as conscripti. Others think that there was
no such distinction, and that the phrase means simply ‘ enrolled senators!
11. subselliorum: wooden benches without backs3 the οὸηευὶᾶνέε (mem—
bers oi consular rank), alluded ιο by Cicero as principes eius ordinis,
occupied seats near the praetorii, the class to which Catiline belonged.
