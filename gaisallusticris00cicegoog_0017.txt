sALLUs'r As A HISTORIAN. xi

quurth'inum, he took care to have many Carthaginian docu-
ments translated for him. To insure greater accuracy he is
said to have commissioned a Greek secretary to prepare a
vcomplete synopsis of Roman history for use in his daily work.

Finally, he was master of a clear, incisive, picturesque
style, peculiarly adapted to the interesting presentation of
historica] facts.

With such qualifications, it is no wonder that he at once
established a high reputation as a historian, and succeeded
to some degree in rivalling his Greek model.

It would be idle to claim that Sallust as a historian had
no faults. But in considering these, it is only fair to re-
member that our conception of history differs widely from
that of the ancientS. In Sallust's time, and for several cen-
turies afterward, history was regarded as merely a branch
of rhetoric, i.e. greater emphasis was to 136 laid on the
“ language and style of the history than on the facts. vWe
must not be surprised, therefore, that Sallust, in common
with other Greek and Roman historians who regarded his-
tory from this point of view, wrote elaborate introductionS,

. put imaginary speeches into the mouths of his principal

character-S, and dared to portray their secret motives and
thoughts as minutely as any realistic novelist of our own
day would do. We may even understand how the stress

⁹ laid on the rhetorical side of history would tend to produce

that occasional neglect of geography and chronology, which
we find, but cannot excuse, in Sallust's writings.

There are, besides, several ‘inaccuracies in his version of
Catiline's conspiracy, for which he has been severely criti-
cised. But in this connection it should 136 remembered
that‘ although it waS, in one sense, an advantage to treat
of a period which came under his persona] observation, on
the other hand it was a distinct disadvantage to write
before sufficient time had elapsed to enable obscure details
