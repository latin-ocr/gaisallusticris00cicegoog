to clear up, and the whole truth to be thoroughly sifted
out. Yet, when against Sallust's faults we balance his vir-
tues, when we consider his broad philosophy, his freedom
from superstition, his respect for the truth, his absolute
impartiality, his powerful descriptions of Roman politics
and society, his cleverness in character sketching, it is not
surprising that he left a profound impression on his age.
He was for a time overshadowed by Livy. But the devel-
opment of a school of historians who took Sallust for their
model attests the triumph of his genius over that of his
rival, and warrants us in accepting Martial's estimate of
him as primus Romana Crispus in historia.

SALLUST’S STYLE.

Sallust's style is very different from that of his predeces-
sorS, Caesar and Cicero. For while their writing is smooth
and regular, Sallust's is strong and abrupt, at times start-
ling in its sudden changes, often almost volcanic in action.
In many particulars Sallust resembles Carlyle. He dis-
plays the same rugged individuality, the same fondness for
unusual words and expressionS, the same power of graphic
description, the same proneness to moral reflection, the
same tone of sarcastic criticism in dealing with men's
faults and viceS, that characterize the Scotch philosopher.

ε The picturesquenesS, vigor, and intensity of Sallust's
style were greatly admired by his countrymen. But the

best evidence of the true value of his writings is found in ·

the fact that time only served to increase the appreciation
of them, and that they continued to be popular even in the
Middle AgeS. -

Following are the special‘characteristics of Sallust's style,
of which the reader will find abundant illustration in the
text of the Bellum Catilinae.
