10. οοΙόῐιὶῑε et municipiis: originally the Romans planted colo-
nies on their frontier to protect it against the enemy. The inhabitants
of the maritime colonies along the coast retained the rights of Roman
citizenship, while those of the military or inland colonies lost their
citizenship and became LatinS. Marius and Sulla also established
colonies for their veteran soldiers in different parts of Italy. The
manicipia were Italian towns annexed to Rome, which retained the
rights of local sels-government. At the close of the Social War,
nc. 89, all the colonies and municipal towns were granted full rights
of citizenship, and thereafter there was practically no difference be-
tween them. domi nobiles : the smaller towns, imitating Rome,
had their own nobility. 16. vivere obpia z* a colloquialism for

of war to the tameness of a peaceful life.

18. Μ. Licinium Crassum: the richest Roman of his time; he

was believed to be worth 88‚500,000. He had gained this fortune ·

partly by buying confiscated estates during Sulla’s dictatorship, and
selling them when they had risen in value, partly by educating and
selling slaves. He is also said to have been in the habit of purchasing
houses which were on fire, together with those adjoining them, at a
low figure. Thereupon a band of his slaviae, carefully trained as a
fire brigade, rushed in and extinguished the fire. By rebuilding these
houses, Crassus soon became the largest real estate owner in Rome.

19. invisus ipsi: Pompey and Crassus had been rivals under Sulla
in 83. In the war with Spartacus, nc. 71, Crassus won the decisive
battle3 but Pompey, happening to meet some scattered remnants of
Spartacus's army, cut them to pieces, and for this brilliant exploit
claimed and received the glory of finishing the war! In the following
year they were reconciled, and were colleagues in the consulship.
But Pompey’s recent victories in the East had again roused the jealous
enmity of Crassus. 20. cuiusvis, etc. ε ‘ he (Crassus) was willing
to see any one's influence increase, if only it was at the expense of
Pompey's power 3 at the same time he was confident,’ etc.
