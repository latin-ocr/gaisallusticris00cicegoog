usurers from obtaining higher rates. patriae . . . expertes:
men who were forced to leave their country for fear they might be
held for debt. Note that Sallust uses both the genitive (patriae)
and the ablative (Ῑᾶτηᾶ atque seminis) with expertes ; the ablativo
is archaic.

19. more maiorum lege uti: the earliest laws of debt at Rome
were very severe. When the claim of the creditor had been confirmed
by a trial before the praetor, the debtor might be confined in a dun-
geon for sixty dayS‚ and then, if the debt was not paid‚ he might be
put to death or sold as a slave. The Lex Poetelia Papiria (B.c. 326)
abolished all power over the person of the debtor. It is evident from
the text, however, that the law was not being enforced‚ and that the
debtor might forfeit not only his property, but his personal freedom.

21. praetbrfn: the enforcement of the law of debt was largely left
to the discretion of the praetor urbanus, before whom such cases were
tried. But it was not altogether safe to be kindly disposed to the
debtorS, as may be inferred from an instance in nc. 89, in which
Aselli0‚ a praetor, was actually murdered by some usurers for yielding
to the claims of certain debtors. vostrum: the use of this form of
the genitive plural of the pronoun as a possessive belongs to early Latin.
In classical writing it isusually partitive. (In the few instances where
it denotes possession it is regularly accompanied by omnium.)

24. argentum aere solutum est: in the payment of debts the
Lex Valeria (nc. 86) required that an ᾶε, a copper coin worth about
one cent, should be taken for a msceres, a silver coin worth about
four cents, just as with us a bankrupt pays 25 cents on a dollar.
2⁵. Saepe . . . plfibfis . . . sficossft: there were three secessions
of the plebs ε (1) in nc. 494 the people withdrew to the Sacred Mount
on account of debt, and compelled the patricians to grant them trib-
unes3 (2) in nc, 449 they seceded again to the Sacred Mount, on
account of the outrageous conduct of Appius Claudius and his col-
leagues, whom they forced to resign from the Second Dece'mvirate3
(3) in ¹³:0- 286 they withdrew to the J aniculum on account of debt,
and secured the passage of the Hortensian laW‚ providing that all
resolutione passed by the plebs (plebiscita) should be valid for the
whole people. 29. nemo bonus: ‘ no honorable maii!

Pago 25. 1. cdnsulfitfs: object clause without ut, dependent
on obtestamur. 3. neve, etc. ε ‘ and not lay upon us the necessity
of secking how we may best avenge our blood and then perish.'
