18. pedibus aeger: Dio Cassius, the historiam, says that Anto-

· nius pretended to be afflicted with the gout, in order to avoid directing

the battle against his old friend Catiline. In this connection it has
been suggested that, although Antonius’s force was larger than that
of Metellus, Catiline chose to J‘oin battle with the former, because he
hoped that their old time friendship might influence Antonius to let
the victory go to him. 19. Μ. Petrei6: see Vocab. 3 in the civil

ἓῸΟ. It is impossible to estimato the number of those engaged
on each side with any accuracy. As to Catiline's force, although at
one time he had two full legions, we are told that many deserted him
on hearing of the execution of the conspirators at Rome (see 53, 1-5).
Dio Cassius declares that Catiline had only 3000 111611. The same
historian states that Antonius had a larger force than Metellus, As
Metellus, according to Sallust, 53, 8, had three legionS, Antonius prob-
ably had 15,000 to 20,000 men. With forces so unequally matched⁴
the result could not long be in doubt.
