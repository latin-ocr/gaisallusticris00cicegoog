relative of the dictator3 in nc. 62 he was successfully defended by
Cicero against a charge of being concerned in both conspiracies.
ᾱόοἱςηᾶιῑ conules: the electione were usually held in Jnly, the
inauguration on the following lst of J anuary. legibus ambitfis:
bribery was very common. To prevent detection‚ the money passed
through the hands of three intermediate persone. Several laws had
been enacted against bribery, the most recent and severe being the
Lex Acilia Calpurnia (sc. 67), which provided that any person con-
victed of this offence should be heavily flned and never again be per·
mitted to hold office. 2⁷. interrogati: the interr-cycizi& was a
formal examination of the accused by the praetor, as a preliminary to
the regular trial. poenas dederant: i.e. being found guilty, they
suffered the penalty prescribed by the laW, and a new election was
ordered, for which Catiline wished to present himself as a candidate.
28. pecuniarum repetundarum reus: ‘ charged with extortion ⁹
(literally ⁴ accused of moneys to be demanded back ²). In the year after
his praetorship (13.c. 67) Catiline was governor of the province of
Africa. In 66, immediately on his return to Rome in order to be a

· candidate for the consulship of 65, the provincials entered a formal

complaint of extortion against him before the Senate. Such a charge
did not absolutely debar the accused from being a candidate, but left
it to the discretion of the presiding magistrate. In this -case, as the
decision of the consul, L. Tullus, was unfavorable to Catiline, he was
compelled to give up all hope of being consul in 65.

29. intra legitumos dies: a person was required to make formal
announcement to the consul, at least 17 days before the election, of
his intention to be a candidate. Catiline of course could not do s0,
. merely because the consul persisted in refusing to permit him to be
a candidate. The phrase quod . . . nequiverat therefore does not
give the real reason for the consul's action (the charge of extortion),
but may have been assigned as the reason in his formal report of the
case. 31. factiosus: ‘a demagogue.’

Pago 13. 1. Cum hoc . . . consilio communicat-,62 ‘Con-
certing together with this man.’ 2. in Capitfflio: on the inau-

gural day, a procession of the Senate, equites, and distinguished

. citizens escorted the consuls elect to the magnificent temple on the

Capitol, where a sacrifice of white bulls was offered ιο Jupiter with

solemn vows, 3. 1.. Cottam et 1... Torquatum: who had been .
elected in place of Autronius and Sulla. 4. fascibus correptis.-
