SALLUST’S wm'rmas. ix

celebrated gardens (horti Sallustiani) near the porta Salaria
on the Quirinal hill, where he also built a palatial residence
for himself. ,

After the death of Caesar in Β.0. 44, Sallust retired from
public 1116, and, returning to the ambition of his younger
days, devoted his leisure to Roman history. 'He died in
Β.ο. 35, leaving his house and gardens to his sister's grand-
son. These afterward became the favorite resort of Nero,
Nerva, and other Roman emperors.

sALLthT’s WRITINGS.

Sallust undertook to write 011 special periods 01 Roman
history. As these are closely related to each other in time,
it may have been his plan ultimately to. weld them together
so as to make a connected account 01 the century in which
Rome gradually changed from a republic into an empire.

His first effort was the Bellum Catilinae, a subject with
which he must have been thoroughly familiar, because as a
young man, twenty-three years old, he was an eye-witness
01 the exciting events which took place in Β.0. 63, and
because he was personally acquainted with many who were
concerned 111 the conspiracy. The work is especially valu-

able 101· the light it throws on the politics and morals of >

the time. In Sallust's view the plot may be regarded as
the natural outgrowth 01 widespread debt and great corrup·
tion among the Romans.

The Bellum Catilinae was followed by the Bellum quurthi-
num, a picturesque account of the wily Numidian prince,
who bribed Roman senators and generals alike, but who
was at last captured by Sulla, and put to death 111 the
Mamertine prison. In this narrative, Sallust's main object
seems to have been to depict the baseness 01 the senatorial
order in the most striking colors.
