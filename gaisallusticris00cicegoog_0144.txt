Catiline’s speech to his soldiers. Section 58.

5 68. outline os the speech. —I am aware, soldiers, that a com-
mander's eloquenoe has but little effect on his army; for a man‘s
behavior in battle is predetermined by hle character. But I have
assembled you for a word of advice and explanation.

You know that Lentulus’s slowness has not only brought us disas-
ter in the city, but has prevented me from proceeding to Gaul. Mean-
while our situation here has become perilous. Our only hope is to cut
our way through the enemy. Therefore be brave. Victory will open
all Italy to us; defeat means our utter ruin. Besides, we are fighting
for fatherland, for freedom, for life3 they only for the aggrandizement
ot a few families.

You might have lived on in exile, or ln disgrace and misery at Rome.
But you chose to be men. Then be bold and face the enemy.

When I think of your determination and valor, —ay, and ot your
desperate necessity, t00, — 1 am filled with hope. The enemy cannot
surround us in this narrow pass. But even if we are overpowered
by numbers, let us not be taken captive to be slaughtered afterward
like cattle, but let us quit ourselves like men and die, leaving the
enemy to mourn a costly and bloody victory.
