As Sallust affected an archaic style, many words in his writings were
spelled in an old-fashioned way, much as though an author os our own
times were to adopt the spelling in vogue a halt century ag0. The text
of this edition, therefore, presents the following variations from the spell-
ing in other Latin authors that are commonly read in our schools: (1) -is
instead of -ἓε in the accusative plural of -i stems of the third declension, as
omnis for omne& (2) -umus instead ot -imus in superlatives and ordinals‚
as maxumus sor maximum (3) -undus instead of -endus in gerunds and
gerundives of the third and fourth conjugations, as ayundus for aymam,-
(4) -u- instead os -i- in certain words, as lubido sor libid6; (5) -vos instead
of -vus in second declension nouns and adjectives‚ as novos for novus,-
(6) vo- instead of ve· or vu- in certain words, as vort6 for verto, volnus sor
vulnus,

there is much uncertainty as to the title which Sallust himself gave
to this history. Some editors prefer Dm Cunnum Comthronn,
which is evidently borrowed from an expression occurring in the
text, 3, 20. Others find the title in the words appended to the Cati-
line in the best manuscript extant (the Paris), viZ. C. SALLVSTII
CRISPI BELLVM CATILINI} EXPLICIT. Quintilian, in referring
to both the works of Sallust, writes in bello Juyurthlnb et Catilinae.
The fact that Florus, the historian, also names his account of the con-
spiracy BELLUM CA‘riLnun strengthens the probability that this was
the original title.
