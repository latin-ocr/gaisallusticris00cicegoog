rather than to Metellus. However‚ Metellus did obtain a triumph
finally, in s.0. 62.

1⁷. ad urbem: if a victorious general entered the walls of the
city, he thereby forfeited his imperium, and with it all right to cele-
brate a triumph. To avoid this difficulty, the Senate usually met out-
st‘de the city, in the temple of Apollo or Bellona, to decide whether
the general was eutitled to a triumph. The most important of the
conditions to be fulfllled were: (1) the general must have held the
office of dictator, consul, or praetor3 (2) the war must have been
waged against a foreign country, no triumph being granted in a civil
⁶war 3 (3) the dominion of Rome must have been extended3 (4) the
enemy must have been reduced to an actual state of peace, admitting
of the withdrawal of the Roman soldiers that they might participate
in the triumph at Rome.

17. triumpharent: the Senate led the procession, being followed
by the trumpeters. Then came wagons and litters piled high with
booty, while captive kings and princes marched along, some in sad

, submission, others in haughty disdain. Next was seen the victorious

general, arrayed in an embroidered toga, proudly driving an ivory

, chariot drawn by four horses. Last of all came the valiant soldiers,

whose efforts had contributed so much to the success of the expedi-
tion. The procession moved up the celebrated Via Sacra, through

CICERO.

Pago 21. 1. senatus consultum (of October 21st): if a measure passed
by the Senate was not vetoed, either by the magistrate who convoked the
Senate or by some other magistrate who was his equal or superior, it was
assumed that it would pass in the popular assemblies, and was then called
εεηᾶεᾶε οὸηεαῑεωη, i.e. ⁴ an ordinanceof the senate.' But if it was vetoed‚
it was merely auctor-ictis εεηᾶιᾱε, i.e. ‘ the deliberate utterance of the
Senate.’ It was not absolutely binding in either case. But so great was
the influence of the Senate‚ that its advice was very rarely disregarded by
either magistrates or people.

2. in tabulis: bronze or marble tablets on which the laws were in-
scribed. After being displayed in public for seventeen days, they were
stored away in the treasury (aerarium). 3. interfectum esse: a few
verbs of wishing} and necessity are sometimes followed by the perfect
passive infinitivo, instead of the usual present, especially in early Latin.
6. dicere: the present infinitive regularly follows memini, when the
latter refers to a personal experienoe. 10. hominem: contemptuous,
⁶ the fellow.'
