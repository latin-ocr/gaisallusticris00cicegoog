HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

——000—

Fon more than a century befo're the Empire was estab-
lished, Rome was a republic only in name, since the gov-
ernment was in the hands not of the people‚ but of the
Senat‘e. In earlier times the Senate, composed of the ablest
and most experienced men in the state, had exercised a wise
and beneficent control over the people. But the conquest of
foreign territory, and the Subsequent establishment of the
provinces, had wrought a great change in the character of
its members. Once they had been famous for their integ'rity
and patriotism3 now they were a selfish‚ sordid body of
men, whose highest ambition was to enrich themselves by
plundering the provinces. Their families constituted an
exclusive aristocracy‚ as proud and arrogant as were the
patricians of the early republic.

And yet, although the Senate had shown itself utterly un-
worthy and incompetent to ru1e‚ it took more than a hun-
dred years to overthrow it. G. Gracchus made a vigorous
attack upon it, 13.o. 121, but he failed to accomplish anything
permanent. In 87, the Marian party triumphed for a time,
but its rule was worse than that of the Senate‚ and the
inevitable reaction came on the return of Sulla from the far
East. Then followed a period in which the Senate seemed
to be possessed of all its old-time power. But beneath the
surface there was an ever increasing restlessness which
found occasional vent in startling plots among the people

against the government.
