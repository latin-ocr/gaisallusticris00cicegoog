number volunteered to assassinate Cicero. But the latter
was apprised of their intention and prevented the attack.

On November 8th, after taking unusual precautions against
an uprising‚ Cicero convoked the Senate in the temple of
Jupiter Stator. Catiline actually had the audacity to be
present. Then Cicero, in fierce indignation at the man's
effrontery, burst forth with what has been called his Fir-st
Oration aqainst Catilina The facts which Cicero presented
in regard to the conspiracy were so conclusive that Catiline
thought it wise to leave Rome that very night, and hasten
northward to the force which his lieutenant Manlius had
gathered at Faesulae in Etruria. On the following morn-
ing, November 9th, Cicero addressed the people in the
Forum in his Second oration, exulting in the fact that the
arch-conspirator had withdrawn from the city.

Toward the close of November, news came that Catiline
had J'oined Manlius, whereupon the Senate declared them
both enemies of the state and directed Antonius to sup-
press the insurrection. At about the same time, Cicero
defended L. Licinius Murena in a trial for bribery at the
consular election, delivering his witty and effective Pro
Μᾶνόηᾶ (fretcio, a selection from which appears on page 18.

Meanwhile the conspirators in the city had not been idle.
In their desire to get help from every source, they even
„dared to approach some ambassadors from the disaffected
Allobroges, who had come to Rome to seek aid from the
Senate. These men, although sorely tempted, finally in-
formed Cicero, and were directed by him to pretend to join
the* plot, and to obtain, if possible, written proof against
the conspirators. This they succeeded in doing, and in
consequence five of the leaders were arrested and thrown
into prison. On the same day, December 3d, Cicero deliv-
ered his Third Oratio‘n to the people, giving them the latest
information concerning the plot.
