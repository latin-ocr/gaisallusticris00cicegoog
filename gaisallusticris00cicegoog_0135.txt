Plan 41] noras. 109

Not that any penalty will be too severe; it is only that we are
establishing a bad precedent. Consider the disastrous consequences
of such measures in the case of the Thirty Tyrants and of Sulla.

Let us not presume to be wiser than our fathers, who forbade both
scourging and capital punishment.

I move, therefore, that the property of these men be confiscated3
that they themselves be imprisoned for life in the municipal towns ;
and that any one who shall refer to them, either in the Senate or in
any public assembly‚ shall be held guilty of high treason.

13. OmnIs homines: cf. Sallust’s introductory sentence, 1, 1.
putres conscripti: see note to Cicero, 22, 7. 16. neque, etc:
‘ nor has any one ever been guided by passion and his true interest
at the same time.’ 18. animus: ‘ the reason.' Magna, etc.:
&I have abundant material from which to remind you.’ 21. con-

Pago 41. 1. Rhodffirum civitas: in the war which the Ro-
mans waged with Antiochus the ¹ Great, king of Syria, 1³.c..192-190‚
RhodeS, at that time a maritime power second 'only to Carthage‚
aided the Romam, and was rewarded with the gift of Southern Caria
(quae populi Rbmdn'i opibus creverat). .Twenty years later, in the
Third Macedonian War, 171-168‚ Rhodes made no offer of assistance,
but sent an embassy to conciliate the contestants. The ambassadors,
in their zeal for peace, threatened to declare war upon the nation
which declined to make terms. This angered the RomanS, so that
they in turn were on the point of declaring war upon Rhodes. The
latter made all the reparation possible and succeeded in averting war.
(But it must be added that the Romans punished the Rhodians by
taking back Caria and hopelessly crippling their commerce ; so that
they were not nearly so magnanimous as would appear from the text.)

6. Item bellis Punicis: the Roman historians were very fond
of sneering at Punic saith (Ρᾶηίοα fides). But the most superficial
acquaintance with the facts— as, for example, in the manner of begin-
ning the First Punic War, in the seizure of Corsica and Sardinia
when Carthage was at Rome's mercy, and. in the most unjust exactions
