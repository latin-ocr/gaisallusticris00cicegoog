clauses, the first alluding ιο the popular party, the second to the senas
torial party.

5 39. 8. ad bellum maritumum atque Mithridflticum: in
mc. 67, the Mediterraneum was infested by pirates. From their strong-
holds in Cilicia they swarmed out to plunder vessels and terrorize the
coast cities oi Greece and Asia. They had even become so daring as
to venture up the Tiber and carry off the children oi Roman officials,
in order ιο secure a large ransom.

Pompey had broken with the aristocratic party altogether in ,the
year of his consulship (70), and now, as a victorious general, was the
idol of the common people. When, therefore, Gabinius, a tribune of
the plebs, proposed a law (67) giving Pompey command of the war
against the pirates, Pompey received the appointment by an over-
whelming popular vote, notwithstandlng the bitter opposition of the
optimates. In the war that followed, Pompey exhibited remarkably
clever generalship, sweeping the seas of the marauders in the incredibly
short period of three months. In the next year, while he was engaged
in settling affairs in Cilicia, the Manilian law was passed, transferring
to him' the command of the war against Mithridates. After quickly
conquering this most formidable enemy⁴ he reduced Syria to a Roman
province, and in the year ot the conspiracy was occupied in subdulng
Phoenicia, Coele-Syria, and Palestine.

two prominent men, after Pompey, in the popular party, Crassus pos-
sessed the influence that comes of wealth, but lacked political sagacity,
while Caesar had not as yet shown any strong leadership. Hence
Pompey's departure left the party without any great leader, and to
that extent gave the optimates a certain advantage. But Sallust goes
too far in saying that, after Pompey went, ‘ the resources of the plebs
diminished, while the power of the oligarchy increased.' As a mat-
ter os fact, the plebs gained several signal victories over the optimc'ites
during Pompey’s absence. That, however, does not detract from the
main point Sallust is making in this chapter, —viz. that the spoils oi
office were secured altogether by the nobility, and that this was one
reason why a conspiracy to overturn the existing government appealed
very strongly to the common people.
