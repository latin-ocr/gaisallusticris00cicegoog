PREFAGE.

-000—

SAnms'r's Bellum Catilinae properly introduces Cicero's
Catilinarian Orations. For besides giving a clear account
of the conspiracy in its true historical Setting, it arouses
a deep interest in the moral, social, and politica] life of
Rome during the most important period of her history as

a re ublic.
ἰ Τξθ teacher who takes this view of the Bellum Catilinae
J will naturally strive to stimulate the interest of his classes

by comparing Cicero's statements with those of Sallust.

But to do this effectively, he must place the text of the
Cicero before the pupil, — an awkward necessity, since it
involves the simultaneous handling of two books.
It was in the effort to· obviate this difficulty that the
’ present edition had its inception. The parallel passages
from Cicero, which are incorporated in the text, have been
tested in the class-room, and have been found not merely
interesting, but instructive, since they offer opportunity for
comparing the two authors in points of syntax and style.
1 These selections have been annotated with the same care
as the Sallust, and all words occurring in them have been
included in the Vocabulary.
The text of this edition of the Bellum Catilinae conforms
very closely to that of Director J. H. Schmalz (fifth edition,
1897), whose readings I have almost invariably adopted.
