of the house when the consul put the motion: qui h‘o'c censetis, ἰῑῑῦο
ενᾶπεῖιε, qui alia omnia (censetis), in hanc partem. 10. qui . . .
censuerat: Nero moved that the Senate postpone action on the ques-
tion until the guards had been withdrawn. This was an insinuation
that the Senate was being intimidated by the strong guard of equites
which Cicero had stationed about the temple of Concord. 11. Cae-
sar was now praetor-elect, and therefore would properly speak after
the consulares and before those of his own rank, the praetorii.

Gaesar’s speech to the Senate. Section 51.

561. The situation was critical. At the meeting of the Senate
on December 3d‚ the prisoners had been adjudged guilty not only of
being concerned in a conspiracy against the government‚ but of hav-
ing actually solicited aid for their nefarious scheme from a barbarous
tribe oi Gaul. More infamous treachery could not be imagined.
The Senate had ordered them to be kept ‘⁶ in free custody.” But this “
was practically useless, as plans had already been set on foot by their
triends to employ violence in releasing them. And even if it were
possible to hold them until a regular trial took place, with so far-
reaching a conspiracy there was every likelihood that they would be
acquitted‚ or at least allowed to go into exile, which would be virtually
nothing less than dismissing them to join Catiline. In either event,
their escape from justice would bring the government into contempt,
and might be the turning-point with the still wavering city rabble‚ in
causing them to cast in their lot with Catiline. There could be no
alternative. The emergency demanded the immediate sentence and
execution of the prisoners. Cicero might have ordered them to be
put to death at once on his own authority3 for the εεπᾶιᾶε consul-
tum of October 21st gave the consuls power to take any action which
they deemed necessary for the safety of the state. But he shrank
from assuming the whole responsibility‚ and therefore assembled the
Senate in order to obtain its support in so unusual a step.

Outline os the speech. — Let us discuss this measure dispassionately‚
giving heed to both precedent and propriety.

Silanus blunders in voting for the execution oi the conspiratores,
because death is in no sense an adequate punishment. He should
insist on their being scourged first. If he fears the law against scourg-
ing‚ he will do well to have an equal regard for the law which permits
condemned citizens to go into exile.
