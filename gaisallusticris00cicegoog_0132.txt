Page 39. §49. 3. Q. catulus: see notet025, 17. c. Piso:
like Catulus, he was a leader in the aristocratic party. He had been
consul in 67, and proconsul of Gallia Narbonensis in the year follow-
ing. Recently, in the very year of the conspiracy, he was accused by
the Gauls of plundering their province, and while being tried on this
charge was⁸⁴mther accused ’.1151 Caesar—who was pastorius oi the
province — of maltreating a certain one of the Gauls, 6. uterque

singular. ¹7. in: ‘at the time οἱ)

9. pontificatus: see note to sacerdotia, 15, 32. 10. maxumis
honoribus fisus: Catulus had been consul in ac. 78, censor in 65,
and was now princeps εεηᾶεῠε, 1.0. the first on the list of the senators,
and therefore the first to be called upon to express his opinion on all
questions that came before the Senate; but see note to 40, 4. ab
adulescentulo: Caesar was 37 years of age, while Cato was proba-
bly 60. 12. the adverbs privatim and pfiblice modify the nouns
Πὸονᾶῑίιᾰιε and muneribus, respectively‚ both of these containing the
verbal idea os qivinq. But it is rather singular to have adverbs modi-
fying nouus.

13. grandem pecuniam debebat: even before Caesar held any
public office, his debts amounted to 1300 talents (al‚500‚000). More·
over, throughout his political career, Caesar was recklessly liberal.
It is said that he never turned away any one who wanted money.
In his aedileship he exhibited 320 pairs of gladiatore equipped in sil-
ver, and he even had the wild beasts' cages made of silver. Suetonius
writes that when Caesar was parting with his mother, on the mornlng
01 the pontifical election, overcome by the thought of his enormous
debt, 110 said he should never come home again unless he were elected
pontifex mammas. Indeed, it was not until his return to Rome in 60,
after his governorship ot Spain, that he had the means with which
to pay off his debts.

15. quae ιδ . . . audisse dicerent: occasionally, in causal and
relative clauses, the verb oi savinq itself is put in the subjunctive
instead of the indicative, apparently through carelessneSS, as though
it were in a subordinate clause dependent on an accusative and infini-
tive sentence. 17. equites RdmanI ε naturally men of this order,
whose business interests were endangered by the conspiracy, would be
the most ready to show their indignation when a popular leader like
Caesar was suspected of being concerned in the plot. 21. egredi-
