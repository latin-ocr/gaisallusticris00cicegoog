ready money in most cases had to be borrowed from Roman specula-
tors (πορόεἰᾶιῦνὲε), like the Umbrenus mentioned in this section, who

example, Cicero, in one of his letters, mentions an instance where 48
per cent was demanded on a debt.

Pago 32. 1. Q. Fabio Sangae: nothing further is known of
him, except that he was a descendant of Q. Fabius AllobrogicuS‚ who
conquered the Allobroges in B.c. 121. A province often put itself
under the patronage of the conquering general, who thus became its
representative at Rome. This relation frequently remained‚ as in this ⁶
case, in the general’s family for several generations, In like manner
cities and communities usually chose some one to look after their in-

terests at home. Thus Cicero was the patronus of the town of Reate ;

the Gauls counted for much in their decision on this matter. ex civi-
