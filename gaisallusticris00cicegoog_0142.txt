chamber has given rise to the theory that it was originally a ‘⁴ well
house,” built to guard the water supply of the citadel. As the floor
was but little above the level of the Tiber, it was often flooded, pro-
ducing the dampness and filth so vividly described by Sallust. When
Jugurtha was thrust into this dungeon, he exclaimed, “ By Hercules,
how cold your bath is l ” Triumphal processions on their way to the
Capitol usually halted near the prison until the announcement was
made that the principal captives had been strangled in this gruesome
dungeon.

Tradition declares that St. Peter and St. Paul were cpnfined in this
prison by N ero, and that the spring burst forth miraculously from the
floor, that water might be provided for the baptism of the two J'ailers
and forty-seven prisoners who had been converted under the apostles’
preaching. The visitor to the church of San Pietro in Camere, which
now stands above the prison, is led down by modern stairs into both
these damp and gloomy dungeons‚ and is shown the exact (?) spots
where the apostles were chained, as well as where J ugurtha and the
Catilinarian conspirators were strangled. It is often called the Mamer-
tine prison, —a mediaeval name which it got from a statue of Mars
(Mamers), which stood in a street close by.

1. Tullianum: as Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome, was
said to have built the upper chamber‚ the Romans made a natural —
but inost improbable — inference that Servius Tullius, the sixth king,
added the lower dungeon, and that from him it received its name,
Tullianum. 2. ubi paululum adscendens ad laevam: the
most reasonable explanation of this doubtful passage is that aster
being lowered to the floor of the first chamber‚ one had to go a few
steps to the left to reach the hole into the Tullianum ,· and that, since
the roof of the Tullianum was vaulted‚ the floor above it might have
had a corresponding slope, thus accounting for the word adscen-
deris.

4. camera lapideis fornicibus iuncta: the construction shows
that it belongs to a period before the principle of the arch was known
in Rome, as the vaulted roos is made of stone slabs, each overlapping
the one under it. ⁷. vindices rerum capitalium = tresviri.
10. exitium: an archaism for exitum. 11. eodem modo sup-
plicium snmptum est: cicere, it is said, waited outside the prison
until he was informed that the execution was over. This he announced
to the bystanders with the single word, ‘⁶ vixerunt‚'‘ and then went on
his way.
