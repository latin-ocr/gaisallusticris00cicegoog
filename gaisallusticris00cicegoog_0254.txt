A «Iunior Latin Book.

With N otes‚ Exercises. and Vocabulary. by Professors Jox-IN C. ROLFB
and WALTER DENNISQN, of the University of Miehigan. ramo, half

leather. 498 pageS. Price‚ βας.

HIS book will appeal most forcibly both to those teachers
who are accustomed to begin the course in Latin Reading
with the difficult Gallie War, and to those who prefer to pre-
pare the way to caesar by the use of some easier text. To the
former it offers a book that can be begun long before their classes
can read Caesar-a distinct economy of time. ‚To the latter it
gives in a single carefuuy graded volume the varied and profita-
ble material that has hitherto been available only by the purchase
of several text-books - a distinct economy of meanS.

The text consists of Fables, Stories of Roman Histo based
on Eutropius and Livy, extracts from Viri Romae, εενΞΙᾸνεε
of Nepos, and Books Laud II. of the Gallie book
also contains exercises for translation into La ,based on the

text, and many good maps and plans. ι

J. Ο. xirtlamd, Jr., Phillips Academy, Exeter, NA. .· We are using Rolfe
and Dennison's Junior Latin Book with the class which began the study
os Latin last September. The Roman history especially appealed to us,
and we are not surprised to find by experience that it furnishes most
satisfactory material for first reading.

J. Edmund Baros, Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Conn. .· The selections are,
it seems to me, well adapted to provide a substitute for the traditional
four Books οἱ Caesar. It is an admirably common-sense text-book.

J. R. L. Johnson, Piedmont Academy, Gordonsville, Va. .· It is one of the
most important contributions to the study of Latin which has appeared
sor years, and one whichs must inevitably attract the interest of all tench-
ers, as it is admirably suited for the purposes for which it is intended.

Nathan Β. Coy, Principal of Cutler Academy, Colorado springs, Col. .·
After giving the Junior Latin Book careful inspecti0n‚ 1 do not hesi·
tate to pronounce it the very best book for second-year Latin with which
1 have any acquaintance.

capt. 0. W. Now, St. John' s Military Academy‚Delafield,Ws.:1antici·
pate good results from the use of the Junior Latin Book. It is fitted
for its purpose exactly‚ aad forms a good substitute for four long Bo'oks
