Of the many attempts that were made to wreck the exist-
ing order of things, the conspiracy of Catiline must be
regarded as by far the most daring and insidious. Its
leader, Catiline, was an extraordinary character. Born B.c.
108, of a most noble but impoverished family, he early
distinguished himself by his recklessness in crime. His
bloodthirstiness during Sulla's proscriptions may be partly
explained as the natural effect of such frightful soenes upon
a fierce, revengeful disposition. But his subsequent crimes,
among which was the deliberate murder of his own son, are
evidences of the utter lack of any moral sense. He waS‚
however, a consummate actor, and could play any role he
chose to assume. This, together with great personal mag-
netism, gave him a certain popularity and leadership, which
encouraged him, notwithstanding his crime-stained career,
to hope for the highest honors. ·

In 68 he was praetor, and in the following year he went
as propraetor to govern the province of Africa. Not con-

' tent with this, he returned before the close of his term,

with the expectation of securing the consulship. But, be-
ing charged with extortion by representatives from Africa,
he failed to obtain the consul's consent to his candidacy.
'Toward the end of the year, he took some part in the abor-
tive “ conspiracy of 663² In 65 he was again prevented from
being a candidate for the consulship by the trial for extor-
tion, which was still pending. At last, getting clear of this,
he made an active canvass in 64 for the next year's consul-
ship. Fortunately for the government, the senatorial party
became alarmed at his radical programme, and cast its votes
for Cicer0, electing the latter by a large majority. Antonius
received a few more votes than Catiline, and became Cicero's
colleague. Nothing daunted, Catiline was once more a can-
didate in 63, but was defeated, mainly through the efforts
of Cicero.
