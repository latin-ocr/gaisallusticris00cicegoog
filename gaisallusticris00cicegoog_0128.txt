Pago 84 1. exemplum: as we have seen in ς 34, this word
ie used to denote ⁸ an exact copy.' A careful comparison of the letter
as reported by Cicero below with this as given by Sallust will show
that. they are identical in thought and in several expressions It is
probable, therefore, that Sallust reproduced the letter exactly, while
Cicero merely quoted from memory. 2. Qui sim = ⁴ What sort ot
man I am,’ while Cicero's Quis sim = ‘Who I am.' But such nice
distinctions would hardly be observed in a hurriedly written letter.
The student, however, will be interested in noting the shades oi differ-
ence between the corresponding expressione, e.g. coqnb'scae'zs and scic&
memineris ιὸ virum esse and Οᾶνᾶ ut vir sis, etc. 3. Pac obgites:

Servile War. Two years after the conspiracy, nc. 61, he was pro-
praetor οῗ Gallia NarbonensiS, and defeated the Allobroges when they .
rebelled against Rome.

11. praetoribus: although the city praetors were primarily con· '

cerned with the administration of justice, they might be called upon
