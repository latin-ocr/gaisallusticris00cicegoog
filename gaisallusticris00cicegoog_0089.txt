5 4. Hence, when 1 retired from public life, I determined not to
⁴ waste my time in menese, or even in agriculture or hunting3 but,
returning to my earlier aspiratione, Ι resolved to write the history of
different periods of the Roman people. Therefore Ι purpose to give
a brief account of a most remarkable plot against the government‚
known as the conspiracy of Catiline. But first a few words on Cati-
line's character.

pressed, that men, whenever possible, should engage in intellectual
pursuits. Hence agriculture and hunting, which exercise the body
chiefly, might well be left to slaves 15. sed, etc.: ‘ but returning

Character os Catilina Section 5.

§5, Catiline's mad desire to seize the government‚ as Sulla had
done, was constantly increased by want of means and, by a guilty con-
science. His project was favored by the low state of morals among
the people. Here begins an account of the gradual corruption of
Roman character.

25. nobili genere natus: the Sergian gens to which Catiline
belonged claimed descent from the Trojan Serqestus ,· cf. Vergil’s
Aeneid‚ V, 121, Βενρεεειιεᾳιιε, domus tenet a quo Seryia nomen.
Catiline’s great-grandfather, M. Sergius Silus, won great distinction
in the Second Punic War; so eager was he to fight that on losing his
right hand'in battle, he had it replaced by an iron hand. The family
wealth had been much reduced, and the little that was handed down
to Catiline was entirely insufficient to withstand the drain caused by

his youthsul extravagances.
