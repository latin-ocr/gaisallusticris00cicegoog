22. fecere: used absolutely, i.e. without any obJ’ect expressed.
23. populo Romano: Q. Fabius Pictor and L. Cincius AlimentuS,
the best of the early Roman historians, were mere annalists‚ who wrote
altogether in Greek. Cato the Censor, so. 184, who was Sallust's
model in many particulare, was the first to write a history in Latin.
With the exception of Julius Caesar, whose writings are memoirs
rather than histories, Rome produced no historian of ability before
Sallust. 24. obpia: ‘ advantage.’ prudentissimus quisque:
‘all their ablest men.’ B. 252, 5, 03 A. 93, ος Η. 515, 2 ; G. 318, 2.

ἓ 9. But to ‘resumez The Romans of the early republic were a
people of good morals, thrifty and harmonious at home, brave and
energetic in the field. 'Their success was due to their daring in war
and their fairness in peace. That these qualities were characteristic
of them is proven by the fac‘t that in war the penalty for disobedience

Punic War, nc, 218-201, that the Romans began to show unmistakable
signs of deterioration. Before that, they had been for the most part
simple peasantS, remarkable for their industry in peace and their
aggressiveness in war, 30. isis bonumque, etc.: ‘ J‘ustice and
goodness prevailed among them, not so much because they were com-
pelled to practice these virtues by their laWS, as from their natural
inclination.' 31. valebat: the verb is in the singular, although
there are two subjecta B. 255, 3; A. 205, b; H. 392, 4; G. 285, 2.

Pago ’7. 1. suppliciis, which generally means ‘ punishment,' is
an archaism for supplicationibus, ‘ thanksgivings.' On these thanks-
giving days all the templcs were thrown open to the public. Pfiests
and people, crowned with bay wreathS, marched in processioa to all
