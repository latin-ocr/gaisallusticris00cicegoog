elections were held in the Campus Martius. Along the sides of this
. great plain, enclosures called saepta were roped off for the different
centuries to occupy. Each voter was provided with tickets containing
the names of the candidates. When all was ready, a lot was cast to
determine which century of the first class should vote first. Then the
voters of the fortunate century filed through a narrow passageway
called the pone, and deposited their votes in a boat. The vote of this
century was announced at once, as it was supposed that the gods had
guided the lot, and thus indicated their choice of the candidates, Then
the rest of the centuries of the first class voted‚ followed by the other
classes in order, an extra century for belated citizens being allowed to
vote with each of the four lower classes. A maiority of the 377 centu-
ries decided the election.

began to show some appreciation of Greek culture, and regularly
