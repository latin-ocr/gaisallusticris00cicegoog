· the seizure of the fasces would imply that they at once assumed con-
sular authority. .

6. in: how should the proposition be translated in view of the
case it governs‘t’ transtulerant: the use of the pluperfect for the
perfect is not uncommon in Sallust. It is as though the author, pro-
jecting himself into the next sentence, described the action as com-
pleted beforehand. 10. patratum: an old word rarely found
in Cicer0, and never in Caesar. 11. ea rba: Suetonius tells us of
a suspicion that Crassus and Caesar were the leading spirits in this
plot of 66, and adds that Caesar did not give the pre-arranged signal,
— which was to allow his toga to slip off his shoulder, — because

Crassus failed to appear at the last moment. This is very doubtful,
to say the least.

ἓ 19. 13. quaestor pro praetore: after their year of office,
the consuls and praetors were appointed by the Senate to act as
governors in the provinces, ruling pro consule or pro praetore,
i.e. being vested with the powers of a consul or of a praetor. The ten
quaestors who went with them were the treasu'rers for the army and
province. Occasionally, as in the case of Piso, a quaestor was made
governor of a province, with rank as praetor. 1¹7. ἕ. ιδ publica z
‘ from the seat of government.' boni: the senatorial or aristocratic
party.

18. in οδε i.e. in Piso. potentia Pompei: Pompey had been
remarkably successful in all the wars he had undertaken‚ and had
added to his prestige by his recent victory over the pirateS. He was

—now the military idol of the Roman plebS. 23. veteres fidosque
clientis: provincials often asked the. general who had conquered
them to allow them to be his clients in order to secure his support at
Rome. voluntate eius: as they could not easily communicate

with Pompey in the East, they probably consulted their imaginations
freely as to what he would approve.

CICERO.

Pago 13. 2. horum: sc. semitorum. 3. pridie Kalendas: here ·
Cicero only appears to differ with Sallust as to dates; for Cicero does not
say that any attempt was made to 1ιίἰί the consuls on December 3lst, but
simply that Catiline stood armed in the comitium. That Catiline should
thus go armed on the day before the attack is in keeping with his reck·
less audacity. 4. manum: ‘band.' 5. nbn mentem aliquam:
⁸ not any change of purpose)
