was finished‚ two years afterward, as set forth in the Twelve Tables,
much of it was supposed to have come from the Greeks. This was

24. anaeque lege· . . . quibus legibus: the repetition of the
antecedent in the relative clause was characteristic of Caesar’s style;

at the age of thirty-tvm, he was tribune of the people. The following
speech brings out clearly his seli-righteousneSS, his unyielding sear-
lessneSS, his proneness to censure the looseness of Roman morale, and
his unswerving loyalty to his country. His character is admirably
sketohed by Sallust in ξ 54.
